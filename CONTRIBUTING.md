### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Check the [issues](../../issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Check if the issue has been fixed** â€” try to reproduce it using the latest `main` or `master` branch in the repository.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](../../issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Check the [issues](../../issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Make sure your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project**.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](../../issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
- **List some other applications where this enhancement exists.**

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
- Follow the [style guides](#style-guides)
- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests for any new code
- Document new code
- End all files with a newline

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the project's `.eslintrc` configuration
- Prefer ES6 classes over prototypes
- Use ES6 syntax when possible
- Use strict equality checks (`===` and `!==`) over loose ones (`==` and `!=`)
- Prefer arrow functions `=>` over the `function` keyword
- Prefer template strings over string concatenation
- Prefer promises over callbacks
- Prefer async/await over raw promises

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for documentation
- Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
  - Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
  - Reference instance methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
  - Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
