The 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised Points of Focus — 2022) (2017 TSC) presents control criteria established by the AICPA’s Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC) for use in attestation or consulting engagements to evaluate and report on controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of information and systems used to provide products or services (a) across an entire entity; (b) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; (c) within a function relevant to the entity’s operational, reporting, or compliance objectives; and (d) for a particular type of information used by the entity.

## Revisions in This Version

This version of the 2017 TSC has been modified to reflect new points of focus and edits to extant points of focus (collectively referred to as revisions) relevant to certain of the trust services criteria. Points of focus represent important characteristics of the criteria. As such, they may assist both management and the practitioner when they are evaluating whether controls were suitably designed and operated effectively to achieve the entity’s objectives based on the trust services criteria.

> The changes to the points of focus in the 2022 revisions do not, in any way, alter the criteria in the 2017 TSC. Such criteria continue to be suitable criteria for use when evaluating controls in any trust services engagement.
