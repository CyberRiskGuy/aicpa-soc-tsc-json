# AICPA SOC Control Requirements

This repository contains SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 Trust Services Criteria (control requirements for SOC) and framework mappings in machine readable format. The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA), originators of the data, do not provide these in a machine readable format so this repository is intended to make it easier to work with the data for compliance-as-code use cases.

## Disclaimer

All source data comes from source files, usually the AICPA website (frequently in PDF files) and the links are listed in the [References](#references) below, or within each subfolder. The source data is not modified, but converted to machine readable formats. All data rights are respective of their owners. If the data is modified, it is noted in the readme file within the subfolder.

This repository is not affiliated with AICPA nor is it an official AICPA product. The data is provided as-is and should be used at your own risk. The data is not guaranteed to be up-to-date or accurate. Please refer to the AICPA website for the most current information.
